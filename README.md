# ðŸŒž Solar Tower Simulation Web Tool

This project is an interactive simulation tool for a **Vertical Solar Tower System**. It allows users to simulate photovoltaic (PV) energy output using real weather data, with options for battery storage and smart grid support. Built in Python using [pvlib](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/), [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io), and optionally hosted on Streamlit Cloud or self-hosted.

## ðŸ“Œ Features/wish list

- **Approximate User Location** based on IP (for Streamlit-hosted version).
- **Primary PV Simulation** using real PVGIS weather data.
- **Battery Simulation** with custom efficiency and capacity.
- **Smart Grid Support** to augment battery and handle power deficit.
- **Interactive Plots** for monthly profiles (with normalized and absolute power).
- **Monthly + Annual Energy Reports**.
- **"Update Simulation" Button** to prevent running simulations on every parameter change.
- Optional email capture before running battery simulation.
